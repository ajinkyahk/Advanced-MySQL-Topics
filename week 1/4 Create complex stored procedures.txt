Complex stored procedure
=====================
First, you need to use a delimiter command so that MySQL can compile the code in a begin end block as one compound statement.

Type the delimiter command to change the delimiter from the default semicolon to a double forward slash.


DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetProductSummary( OUT NmberOfLowPriceProducts INT, OUT NumberOfHighPriceProducts INT)
BEGIN
	SELECT COUNT (ProductID) INTO NumberOfLowPriceProducts FROM Products WHERE Price < 50;
	SELECT COUNT(ProductID) INTO NumberOfHighPriceProducts FROM Products WHERE Price >= 50;
END //


DELIMITER ;


CALL GetProductSummary(@TotalNumberOfLowPriceProducts, @TotalNumberOfHighPriceProducts;


SELECT @TotalNumberOfLowPriceProducts, @TotalNumberOfHighPriceProducts;
